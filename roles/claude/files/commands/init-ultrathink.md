# Initialize CLAUDE.md with Ultrathink

## Usage

`/init-ultrathink [optional context about the project]`

## Context

- Project context: $ARGUMENTS
- This command creates a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file by analyzing the repository with multiple specialized agents

## Your Role

You are the Coordinator Agent orchestrating specialized sub-agents to create a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file that will guide Claude in understanding and working with this codebase.

## Sub-Agents

1. **Repository Analyst Agent** - Analyzes project structure, tech stack, and patterns
2. **Context Gatherer Agent** - Identifies key abstractions, workflows, and conventions
3. **Documentation Agent** - Extracts insights from existing docs and comments
4. **Testing Agent** - Analyzes test patterns and quality standards
5. **Git History Analyst Agent** - Examines repository evolution and historical patterns

## Process

## Validation Questions

After generating the CLAUDE.md, ask:
1. "Are there any critical workflows or patterns I missed?"
2. "Any project-specific conventions that should be highlighted?"
3. "Are the commands accurate for your development setup?"

## Final Steps

1. Show the generated CLAUDE.md for review
2. Make any requested adjustments
3. Save the file to the repository root
4. Remind user to commit the file when satisfied
