# Codex User Memory

## Communication
- Start with the direct answer or action.
- Keep language concise, concrete, and technical.
- If blocked, state the blocker and the next best path immediately.

## Coding Standards
- Prefer simple, maintainable solutions over clever abstractions.
- Add or update tests when behavior changes.
- Keep diffs focused on the requested scope.

## Git Rules
- Never commit unless explicitly requested.
- Use conventional commits when commits are requested.
- Do not add AI attribution lines to commit messages.

## Security
- Never commit secrets, tokens, or credentials.
- Prefer 1Password CLI (`op`) for secret retrieval.
