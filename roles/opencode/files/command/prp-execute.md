description: "Execute a PRP file: /prp-execute <prp-file>"
---

Implement a feature using the PRP file with validation and tracking.

## PRP File: $ARGUMENTS

## Execution Process

### 1. Load PRP
- Read the specified PRP file
- Understand all context and requirements
- Follow all instructions
- Ensure sufficient context for full implementation
- Perform additional research if needed

### 2. ULTRATHINK
Before executing:
- Think deeply about the implementation plan
- Break down complex tasks into manageable steps
- Use TodoWrite tool to create and track plan
- Identify implementation patterns from existing code

### 3. Execute the Plan
- Implement all code per PRP specifications
- Follow patterns and conventions identified
- Reference PRP throughout implementation

### 4. Validate
- Run each validation command from PRP
- Fix any failures
- Re-run until all pass

### 5. Complete
- Ensure all checklist items done
- Run final validation suite
- Report completion status
- Re-read PRP to verify everything implemented

### 6. Reference the PRP
- Can always reference PRP again if needed
- Use error patterns in PRP to fix issues

## Notes
- If validation fails, use PRP error patterns to fix and retry
- Break work into atomic commits
- Test continuously during implementation
- Document any deviations from PRP
